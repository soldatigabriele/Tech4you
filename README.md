<h3>Web Security University project</h3>

The goald of this project is to create an e-commerce website with high security level standards, from the login to the purchase. 
My task in this job was to create a secure way to store users information during the registration and the login into the store.
<br>
I did it using an object oriented design: in the "classes" folder it is possible to see all the classes used by the app to work.
<br>
To store the passwords we used an alghorithm which encrypted data adding a salt string.
